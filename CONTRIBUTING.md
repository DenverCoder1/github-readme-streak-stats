## Submitting Contributions üë®‚Äçüíª

Below you will find the process and workflow used to review and merge your changes.

### Step 0 : Find an issue

- Take a look at the existing issues or create your **own** issues!

![issues tab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63443481/136185624-24447858-de8d-4b0a-bb6b-2528d9031196.PNG)

### Step 1 : Fork the Project

- Fork this repository. This will create a copy of this repository on your GitHub profile.
  Keep a reference to the original project in the `upstream` remote.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/github-readme-streak-stats.git
cd github-readme-streak-stats
git remote add upstream https://github.com/DenverCoder1/github-readme-streak-stats.git
```

![fork button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63443481/136185816-0b6770d7-0b00-4951-861a-dd15e3954918.PNG)

- If you have already forked the project, update your copy before working.

```bash
git remote update
git checkout <branch-name>
git rebase upstream/<branch-name>
```

### Step 2 : Branch

Create a new branch. Use its name to identify the issue you're addressing.

```bash
# Creates a new branch with the name feature_name and switches to it
git checkout -b feature_name
```

### Step 3 : Work on the issue assigned

- Work on the issue(s) assigned to you.
- Make all the necessary changes to the codebase.
- After you've made changes or made your contribution to the project, add changes to the branch you've just created using:

```bash
# To add all new files to the branch
git add .

# To add only a few files to the branch
git add <some files (with path)>
```

### Step 4 : Commit

- Commit a descriptive message using:

```bash
# This message will get associated with all files you have changed
git commit -m "message"
```

### Step 5 : Work Remotely

- Now you are ready to your work on the remote repository.
- When your work is ready and complies with the project conventions, upload your changes to your fork:

```bash
# To push your work to your remote repository
git push -u origin Branch_Name
```

- Here is how your branch will look.

### Step 6 : Pull Request

- Go to your forked repository in your browser and click on "Compare and pull request". Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your contribution.
