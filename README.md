## Quick setup

1. Copy-paste the markdown below into your GitHub profile README
2. Replace the value after `?user=` with your GitHub username

```md
[![GitHub Streak](https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com/?user=DenverCoder1)](https://github.com/DenverCoder1/github-readme-streak-stats)
```

> Note: See below for information about deploying the app on your own

## Options

`user`\* - The GitHub username to show stats for

`theme` - The theme to apply. (See the [list of themes](./docs/themes/README.md)). [Default value: `default`]

`hide_border` - Set to `true` to make the border of the image transparent. [Default value: `false`]

> \* The `user` field is the only required option. All other fields are optional.


## Themes

To enable a theme, append `&theme=` followed by the theme name to the end of the source url:


```md
[![GitHub Streak](https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com/?user=DenverCoder1&theme=dark)](https://github.com/DenverCoder1/github-readme-streak-stats)
```

## How these stats are calculated

This tool uses the contribution graphs on your GitHub profile to calculate which days you have contributed.

To include contributions in private repositories, turn on the setting for "Private contributions" from the dropdown menu above the contribution graph on your profile page.

Contributions include commits, pull requests, and issues that you create in standalone repositories ([Learn more about what is considered a contribution](https://docs.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile)).

The longest streak is the highest number of consecutive days on which you have made at least one contribution.

The current streak is the number of consecutive days ending with the current day on which you have made at least one contribution. If you have made a contribution today, it will be counted towards the current streak, however, if you have not made a contribution today, the streak will only count days before today so that your streak will not be zero.

> Note: You may need to wait up to 24 hours for new contributions to show up ([Learn how contributions are counted](https://docs.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile))

## Deploying it on your own

If you can, it is preferable to host the files on your own server.

Doing this can lead to better uptime and more control over customization (you can modify the code for your usage).

You can deploy the PHP files on any website server with PHP installed or as a Heroku app.
